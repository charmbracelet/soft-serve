ssh git.charm.sh repo blob soft-serve cmd/soft/root.go

# Print a file with syntax highlighting and line numbers
ssh git.charm.sh repo blob soft-serve cmd/soft/root.go -c -l
```

## Installation

Soft Serve is a single binary called `soft`. You can get it from a package
manager:

```bash
# macOS or Linux
brew tap charmbracelet/tap && brew install charmbracelet/tap/soft-serve

# Arch Linux
pacman -S soft-serve

# Nix
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.soft-serve

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://repo.charm.sh/apt/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/charm.gpg] https://repo.charm.sh/apt/ * *" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/charm.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install soft-serve

# Fedora/RHEL
echo '[charm]
name=Charm
baseurl=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://repo.charm.sh/yum/gpg.key' | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/charm.repo
sudo yum install soft-serve
```

You can also download a binary from the [releases][releases] page. Packages are
available in Alpine, Debian, and RPM formats. Binaries are available for Linux,
macOS, and Windows.

[releases]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/releases

Or just install it with `go`:

```bash
go install github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/cmd/soft@latest
```

## Setting up a server

Make sure `git` is installed, then run `soft serve`. That‚Äôs it.

This will create a `data` directory that will store all the repos, ssh keys,
and database.

To change the default data path use `SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH` environment variable.

```sh
SOFT_SERVE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/soft-serve soft serve
```

When you run Soft Serve for the first time, make sure you have the
`SOFT_SERVE_INITIAL_ADMIN_KEY` environment variable is set to your ssh
authorized key. Any added key to this variable will be treated as admin with
full privileges.

Using this environment variable, Soft Serve will create a new `admin` user that
has full privileges. You can rename and change the user settings later.

### Server Settings

Once you start the server for the first time, the settings will be in
`config.yaml` under your data directory. The default `config.yaml` is
self-explanatory and will look like this:

```yaml
# Soft Serve Server configurations

# The name of the server.
# This is the name that will be displayed in the UI.
name: "Soft Serve"

# The SSH server configuration.
ssh:
  # The address on which the SSH server will listen.
  listen_addr: ":23231"

  # The public URL of the SSH server.
  # This is the address that will be used to clone repositories.
  public_url: "ssh://localhost:23231"

  # The path to the SSH server's private key.
  key_path: "ssh/soft_serve_host"

  # The path to the SSH server's client private key.
  # This key will be used to authenticate the server to make git requests to
  # ssh remotes.
  client_key_path: "ssh/soft_serve_client"

  # The path to the SSH server's internal api private key.
  internal_key_path: "ssh/soft_serve_internal"

  # The maximum number of seconds a connection can take.
  # A value of 0 means no timeout.
  max_timeout: 0

  # The number of seconds a connection can be idle before it is closed.
  idle_timeout: 120

# The Git daemon configuration.
git:
  # The address on which the Git daemon will listen.
  listen_addr: ":9418"

  # The maximum number of seconds a connection can take.
  # A value of 0 means no timeout.
  max_timeout: 0

  # The number of seconds a connection can be idle before it is closed.
  idle_timeout: 3

  # The maximum number of concurrent connections.
  max_connections: 32

# The HTTP server configuration.
http:
  # The address on which the HTTP server will listen.
  listen_addr: ":8080"

  # The path to the TLS private key.
  tls_key_path: ""

  # The path to the TLS certificate.
  tls_cert_path: ""

  # The public URL of the HTTP server.
  # This is the address that will be used to clone repositories.
  # Make sure to use https:// if you are using TLS.
  public_url: "http://localhost:8080"

# The stats server configuration.
stats:
  # The address on which the stats server will listen.
  listen_addr: ":8081"

# Additional admin keys.
#initial_admin_keys:
#  - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2..."

```

You can also use environment variables, to override these settings. All server
settings environment variables start with `SOFT_SERVE_` followed by the setting
name all in uppercase. Here are some examples:

- `SOFT_SERVE_NAME`: The name of the server that will appear in the TUI
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_LISTEN_ADDR`: SSH listen address
- `SOFT_SERVE_SSH_KEY_PATH`: SSH host key-pair path
- `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_LISTEN_ADDR`: HTTP listen address
- `SOFT_SERVE_HTTP_PUBLIC_URL`: HTTP public URL used for cloning
- `SOFT_SERVE_GIT_MAX_CONNECTIONS`: The number of simultaneous connections to git daemon

A [Docker image][docker] is also available.

[docker]: https://github.com/charmbracelet/soft-serve/blob/main/docker.md

## Configuration

Configuring Soft Serve is simple and straightforward. Use the SSH command-line
interface to manage access settings, users, and repos.

For more info try `ssh localhost -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 -p 23231 help`. Make sure
you use your key here.

> **Note** The `-i` part will be omitted in the examples below for brevity. You
> can add your server settings to your sshconfig for quicker access.

### Access Levels

Soft Serve offers a simple access control. There are four access levels,
no-access, read-only, read-write, and admin-access.

`admin-access` has full control of the server and can make changes to users and repos.

`read-write` access gets full control of repos.

`read-only` can read public repos.

`no-access` denies access to all repos.

### Authentication

Everything that needs authentication is done using SSH.

By default, Soft Serve gives ready-only permission to anonymous connections to
any of the above protocols. This is controlled by two settings `anon-access`
and `allow-keyless`.

- `anon-access`: Defines the access level for anonymous users. Available
  options are `no-access`, `read-only`, `read-write`, and `admin-access`.
  Default is `read-only`.
- `allow-keyless`: Whether to allow connections that doesn't use keys to pass.
  Setting this to `false` would disable access to SSH keyboard-interactive,
  HTTP, and Git protocol connections. Default is `true`.

```sh
$ ssh localhost settings
Manage server settings

Usage:
  ssh -p 23231 localhost settings [command]

Available Commands:
  allow-keyless Set or get allow keyless access to repositories
  anon-access   Set or get the default access level for anonymous users

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for settings

Use "ssh -p 23231 localhost settings [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

> **Note** These settings can only be changed by admins.

When `allow-keyless` is disabled, connections that don't use SSH Public Key
authentication will get denied. This means cloning repos over HTTP(s) or git://
will get denied.

Meanwhile, `anon-access` controls the access level granted to connections that
use SSH Public Key authentication but are not registered users. The default
setting for this is `read-only`. This will grant anonymous connections that use
SSH Public Key authentication `read-only` access to public repos.

## Authorization

Admins can manage users and manage their keys. Once a user is created and has
access to the server, they can manage their own keys and settings.

To create a new user simply use `user create`:

```sh
# Create a new user
ssh -p 23231 localhost user create beatrice

# Add user keys
ssh -p 23231 localhost user add-pubkey beatrice ssh-rsa AAAAB3Nz...
ssh -p 23231 localhost user add-pubkey beatrice ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

# Create another user with public key
ssh -p 23231 localhost user create frankie '-k "ssh-ed25519 AAAATzN..."'

# Need help?
ssh -p 23231 localhost user help
```

Once a user has access, they get `read-only` access to public repositories.
They can also create new repositories on the server.

Non-admin users can manage their keys using the `pubkey` command:

```sh
# List user keys
ssh -p 23231 localhost pubkey list

# Add key
ssh -p 23231 localhost pubkey add ssh-ed25519 AAAA...

# Wanna change your username?
ssh -p 23231 localhost set-username yolo

# To display user info
ssh -p 23231 localhost info
```

## Repositories

You can manage repositories using the `repo` command.

```sh
# Run repo help
$ ssh -p 23231 localhost repo help
Manage repositories

Usage:
  ssh -p 23231 localhost repo [command]

Aliases:
  repo, repos, repository, repositories

Available Commands:
  blob         Print out the contents of file at path
  branch       Manage repository branches
  collab       Manage collaborators
  create       Create a new repository
  delete       Delete a repository
  description  Set or get the description for a repository
  hide         Hide or unhide a repository
  import       Import a new repository from remote
  info         Get information about a repository
  is-mirror    Whether a repository is a mirror
  list         List repositories
  private      Set or get a repository private property
  project-name Set or get the project name for a repository
  rename       Rename an existing repository
  tag          Manage repository tags
  tree         Print repository tree at path

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for repo

Use "ssh -p 23231 localhost repo [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Creating Repositories

To create a repository, first make sure you are an admin or a registered user.
Use the `repo create <repo>` command to create a new repository:

```sh
# Create a new repository
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream

# Create a repo with description
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"'

# ... and project name
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"' '-n "Ice Cream"'

# I need my repository private!
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create icecream -p '-d "This is an Ice Cream description"' '-n "Ice Cream"'

# Help?
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create -h
```

Or you can add your Soft Serve server as a remote to any existing repo, given
you have write access, and push to remote:

```
git remote add origin ssh://localhost:23231/icecream
```

After you‚Äôve added the remote just go ahead and push. If the repo doesn‚Äôt exist
on the server it‚Äôll be created.

```
git push origin main
```

Repositories can be nested too:

```sh
# Create a new nested repository
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo create charmbracelet/icecream

# Or ...
git remote add charm ssh://localhost:23231/charmbracelet/icecream
git push charm main
```

### Deleting Repositories

You can delete repositories using the `repo delete <repo>` command.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo delete icecream
```

### Renaming Repositories

Use the `repo rename <old> <new>` command to rename existing repositories.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo rename icecream vanilla
```

### Repository Collaborators

Sometimes you want to restrict write access to certain repositories. This can
be achieved by adding a collaborator to your repository.

Use the `repo collab <command> <repo>` command to manage repo collaborators.

```sh
# Add collaborator to soft-serve
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab add soft-serve frankie

# Remove collaborator
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab remove soft-serve beatrice

# List collaborators
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo collab list soft-serve
```

### Repository metadata

You can also change the repo's description, project name, whether it's private,
etc using the `repo <command>` command.

```sh
# Set description for repo
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo description icecream "This is a new description"

# Hide repo from listing
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo hidden icecream true

# List repository info (branches, tags, description, etc)
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo icecream info
```

To make a repository private, use `repo private <repo> [true|false]`. Private
repos can only be accessed by admins and collaborators.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo icecream private true
```

### Repository Branches & Tags

Use `repo branch` and `repo tag` to list, and delete branches or tags. You can
also use `repo branch default` to set or get the repository default branch.

### Repository Tree

To print a file tree for the project, just use the `repo tree` command along with
the repo name as the SSH command to your Soft Serve server:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve
```

You can also specify the sub-path and a specific reference or branch.

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve server/config
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo tree soft-serve main server/config
```

From there, you can print individual files using the `repo blob` command:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo blob soft-serve cmd/soft/root.go
```

You can add the `-c` flag to enable syntax coloring and `-l` to print line
numbers:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost repo blob soft-serve cmd/soft/root.go -c -l

```

Use `--raw` to print raw file contents. This is useful for dumping binary data.

## The Soft Serve TUI

<img src="https://stuff.charm.sh/soft-serve/soft-serve-demo-commit.png" width="750" alt="TUI example showing a diff">

Soft Serve serves a TUI over SSH for browsing repos, viewing files and commits,
and grabbing clone commands:

```sh
ssh localhost -p 23231
```

It's also possible to ‚Äúlink‚Äù to a specific repo:

```sh
ssh -p 23231 localhost -t soft-serve
```

You can copy text to your clipboard over SSH. For instance, you can press
<kbd>c</kbd> on the highlighted repo in the menu to copy the clone command
[^osc52].

[^osc52]:
    Copying over SSH depends on your terminal support of OSC52. Refer to
    [go-osc52](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/go-osc52) for more information.

## A note about RSA keys

Unfortunately, due to a shortcoming in Go‚Äôs `x/crypto/ssh` package, Soft Serve
does not currently support access via new SSH RSA keys: only the old SHA-1
ones will work.

Until we sort this out you‚Äôll either need an SHA-1 RSA key or a key with
another algorithm, e.g. Ed25519. Not sure what type of keys you have?
You can check with the following:

```sh
$ find ~/.ssh/id_*.pub -exec ssh-keygen -l -f {} \;
```
